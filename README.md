# FHIR-Purpose-of-Use-Codeset
Codeset for managing Purpose of Use for New Zealand Applications

We have begun adapting the FHIR Purpose of Use Codeset for use in Aotearoa New Zealand.

This is the url to the original version referenced.

This has been reviewed initially to identify areas where the New Zealand Health Inforamtion Privacy Code applies and where this can be described against the codeset.
