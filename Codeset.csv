2,    CAREMGT,care management,"To perform analytics, evaluation and other secondary uses of treatment and healthcare related information to manage the quality, efficacy, patient safety, population health, and cost effectiveness of healthcare delivery. Explicitly excludes the use of information to organize the delivery of health care for care coordination and case management, or to provide healthcare treatment. Usage Note: The concept of care management is narrower than the list of activities related to more general organizational objectives such as provider profiling, education of healthcare and non-healthcare professionals; insurance underwriting, premium rating, reinsurance; organizational legal, medical review, auditing, compliance and fraud and abuse detection; business planning, development, and restructuring; fund-raising; and customer service. Map: Maps to ISO 14265 Classification Term ""Health service management and quality assurance"" described as ""To inform persons or processes responsible for determining the availability, quality, safety, equity and cost-effectiveness of health care services."" There is a semantic gap in concepts. This classification term is described as activities, i.e., ""to inform persons"" or ""to inform processes"" rather than the rationale for performing actions/operations on information related to the activity.",2020_1_11_2_a,directly related purpose,the disclosure of the information is directly related to one of the purposes in connection with which the information was obtained,

Usage Note: Examples of activities conducted under this purpose of use: provider profiling, risk adjustment, underwriting, fraud and abuse, quality improvement population health and care management. Aligns with HIPAA Operation POU minus coordination of care or other treatment related activities. Similar to the description in SAMHSA Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking. Map: Maps to ISO 14265 Classification Term ""Administration of care for an individual subject of care"" described as ""To inform persons or processes responsible for enabling the availability of resources or funding or permissions for providing health care services to the subject of care.""

Organizing and facilitating care activities and promoting self-management by advocating for, empowering, and educating a person. 4. Ensuring safe, appropriate, non-duplicative, and effective integrated care. The goal is to clearly differentiate this type of coordination of care from HIPAA Operations by specifying that these actions on information are undertaken in the provision of healthcare treatment. For similar uses of this concept, see SAMHSA Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records Supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking, which differentiates concepts of care coordination and case management for the provision of treatment as specifically distinct from activities related to health care delivery management and the operations of organizational entities involved in the delivery of healthcare.

Purpose 1 is equivalent to HL7 treatment purpose of use: ""Clinical care provision to an individual subject of care"" described as ""To inform persons or processes responsible for providing health care services to the subject of care."" The ISO description conflates both of the proposed specializations of HL7 ETREAT: break the glass and the typically broader access to health information normally available to providers who are provisioned for emergency workflows on a regular basis, e.g., Emergency Room providers. Examples of greater access than is normally accessible by providers based on the need to know are access to sensitive information for which access typically requires a patient's consent. This is not an override of a patient's dissent to disclose sensitive information in cases where the applicable policy waives the need for that consent to access this information. In US, Title 38 Section 7332 and 42 CFR Part 2 both permit emergency access without the need to override a patient's consent directive; rather, this access is a limitation to the patient's right to dissent from disclosure.",2020_1_11_2_a,directly related purpose,the disclosure of the information is directly related to one of the purposes in connection with which the information was obtained,
